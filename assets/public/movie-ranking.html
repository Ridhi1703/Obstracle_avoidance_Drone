    <h1>The Best Movie According To Riddhi</h1>
    <h2>My Top #3 Movies Of All-Time.</h2>
    <hr/>
    
    <h3>3 Idiots</h3><p>It tells the story of Farhan and Raju, who form a bond
         with Rancho due to his positive outlook on life in college. Years later,
          a bet gives them a chance to look for their long-lost friend whose 
          existence seems rather elusive. The movie is considered a masterpiece
           and easily one of the greatest Bollywood movies of all time.</p>
           <h3>Bahubali</h3><p>The movie Baahubali has received
             positive reviews from critics.0 Roger Ebert praised
              the action choreography, the operatic plot, and the sense of 
            optimism that undercuts the gouts of blood 
            and thunderous sound effects.</p>
            <h3>IT</h3><p>I had extremely high expectations that only 
                increased when I heard about all the great reviews. And it's by no means a bad movie, but it certainly is a bit of a disappointment. The story isn't very faithful to the book, but it mostly keeps to the spirit of the novel and contains the essential elements. Adapting that 
                book onto the screen is no easy job, 
                so I'm gonna be a bit forgiving.</p>
